The Mipung font family is a fork of Samsung's Breeze Sans for Tizen that fixes bugs and adds functionality

## What is Mipung Sans?

Mipung Sans and Mipung Sans Condensed are derivatives of Breeze Sans and Breeze Sans Condensed respectively.

The initial goal is to fix the outstanding errors outlined in the Google Fonts GitHub issue to generate the static fonts for Mipung Sans and Mipung Sans Condensed:

We could then create variable fonts and italic which would further increase their usefulness.

## What is the licence?

The original Breeze Sans and Breeze Sans Condensed are licenced under Apache 2.0 similar to Google Android. This is a permissive licence does allow derivatives to be relicenced.

Therefore, the Mipung fonts will be SIL OFL 1.1 (without RFN) to be eligible for addition to Google Fonts which is a major goal for this project.

## What is Breeze Sans?
Breeze Sans is a humanist sans-serif font family that was created by the independent British type foundry Dalton Maag after being commissioned by Samsung as the user interface font for their open-source Tizen project.

Much like Roboto for Google Android, it was designed to be legible at very small sizes though it has humanistic flair.

The font family would have been expensive as there are 5 weights (Thin, Light Regular, Medium, Bold) for both Breeze Sans and Breeze Sans Condensed that each have support for the vast majority of the languages that use Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.

The mascot for Tizen is a pinwheel, so a breeze would compliment the pinwheel and make it spin!

## What languages are supported?
I have performed language support testing with Hyperglot: https://hyperglot.rosettatype.com/support

Breeze Sans supports an astonishing 551 languages (with an estimated 3.4 billion speakers)!

428/503 Latin alphabet languages are marked as supported on Hyperglot (including archaic and constructed languages)

* **Latin** - French, Spanish, German, Vietnamese and Esperanto  
* **Greek** - Modern Greek and Pontic Greek, but not Ancient Greek i.e. polytonic Greek which I confirmed using Notepad and a copy of the Hippocratic Oath from Wikisource: https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%99%CF%80%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82_%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%82 
* **Cyrillic** - everything except Northern Kurdish, Orok, Yagnobi and archaic Church Slavic

Other writing systems are not supported.

## Any other ideas?

We could add:

* **OpenType features** - including support for tabular figures and text figures
* **New currency symbols** - UAE dirham, etc.
* **Regional Cyrillic letterforms** - including Bulgarian and Serbian
* **Polytonic Greek** - niche, but it has historic and liturgical usage
* **Monospaced variant** - Mipung Sans Mono has a nice ring to it

We could also create Mipung Sans Fallback for the fallback fonts, but that's currently out of scope.

## Why the name Mipung?

Mipung (미풍) is a Korean word for 'breeze' from the Hanja 微風. Breeze Sans was comissioned for Samsung which is the largest corporation in South Korea.

The name is meant to be fun to say and pay homage to the original team.
